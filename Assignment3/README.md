## Introduction

Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude and longitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. With the widespread use of Wi-Fi communication in indoor environments, Wi-Fi or wirless local area network (WLAN) based positioning gained popularity to solve indoor localization.
WLAN-based positioning systems utilize the Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value. In this project, we focus on fingerprint-based localization. In the positioning phase, when a user reports the RSSI measurements for the multiple APs, the fit algorithm predicts the user position.
